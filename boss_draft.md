# Leading RWS: Fishcake's Real-World Web3 Solution

---

## Part 1 | From RWA to RWS: Web3 Is Searching for Real-World Answers

### 1. Industry Evolution: Web3 Is Actively Returning to the Real World
(Context Setting)

Over the past decade, the blockchain industry has gone through multiple waves:
- ICO → DeFi → NFT → Metaverse
- And today: RWA, Stablecoins, PayFi

Behind all these shifts, there is one clear signal:
👉 The blockchain industry has entered a stage where it must answer the question of real-world value.

**Key Talking Points**
- Early stage: technical feasibility
- Middle stage: financial experimentation
- Today:
  - Who can actually be used in the real world?
  - Who can create sustainable, real-world value?

### 2. From RWA to RWS: An Upgrade in Definition, Not Just a New Narrative

**What is RWS (Real-World Solution)?**
- RWS is a broader and more fundamental concept.
- In a sense:
  - Bitcoin
  - Ethereum
  - Blockchain itself
  - are all real-world solutions.

**Why "RWS today" does NOT simply mean "on-chain payments everywhere"?**

The real world has real friction:
- Existing payment habits
- User onboarding barriers
- Asset security concerns
- Regulatory and compliance costs

So:
- "Everything on-chain payments" is more like the endgame
- At the current stage, RWS should evolve:
  - From decentralized finance
  - To decentralized real-world services

**One-sentence Summary**
RWS = embedding blockchain's value-creation capability into real-world services and interactions.
